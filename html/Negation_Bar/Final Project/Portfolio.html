    <p>A front-end developer builds the front-end portion of websites and web applicationsâ€”the part users see and
        interact with.
        A front-end developer creates websites and applications using web languages such as HTML, CSS, and
        JavaScript that allow users to access and interact with the site or app. When you visit a website, the
        design elements you see were created by a front-end developer.</p>

    <p>
    <h1>What does a front-end developer do?</h1>
    Front-end developers create user interfaces (UI). UI is the graphical layout of an application that determines
    what each part of a site or application does and how it will look. "I've always found crafting polished user
    interactions that surprise and delight users to be the most rewarding and engaging task," says Mari Batilando, a
    software engineer at Meta. "In order to do this, you need to both have an eye for detail and a rock-solid
    understanding of the platform."

    <h1>Front-end developer job description</h1>
    If someone wanted to build a website, they might hire a front-end developer to create the site's layout. The
    front-end developer determines where to place images, what the navigation should look like, and how to present
    the site. Much of their work involves ensuring the appearance and layout of the site or application is easy to
    navigate and intuitive for the user.

    <h1>Average salary for front-end developers</h1>
    As of February 2023, Glassdoor reports an average yearly pay of $84,235 for front-end developers in the US. This
    figure includes an average annual salary of $78,516 and a reported additional pay of $5,719. Additional pay insights
    may include profit-sharing, commissions, or bonuses. Factors like education level, experience, and certifications
    may affect salary range.
