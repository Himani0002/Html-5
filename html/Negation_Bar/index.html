  <p id="PL">A programming language is a system of notation for writing computer programs. Most programming languages
    are
    text-based formal languages, but they may also be graphical. They are a kind of computer language.

    The description of a programming language is usually split into the two components of syntax (form) and semantics
    (meaning), which are usually defined by a formal language. Some languages are defined by a specification document
    (for example, the C programming language is specified by an ISO Standard) while other languages (such as Perl) have
    a dominant implementation that is treated as a reference. Some languages have both, with the basic language defined
    by a standard and extensions taken from the dominant implementation being common.

    Programming language theory is the subfield of computer science that studies the design, implementation, analysis,
    characterization, and classification of programming languages.

    Definitions

    Computer languages vs programming languages
    The term computer language is sometimes used interchangeably with programming language. However, the usage of
    both terms varies among authors, including the exact scope of each. One usage describes programming languages as a
    subset of computer languages.
    Another usage regards programming languages as theoretical constructs for programming abstract machines and computer
    languages as the subset thereof that runs on physical computers, which have finite hardware resources.</p>

  <p id="C">C Overview

    <b>What is C?⁣</b>
    Since the late 19th century, C has been a popular programming language for general-purpose use.
    C language was developed by Dennis M. Ritchie at bell laboratory in early 1970s⁣
    Its applications are very diverse. It ranges from developing operating systems to databases and all.⁣ It is
    system programming language used to do low level programming (e.g., driver or kernel)
    Even if it’s old, it is still a very popular programming language.⁣
    As the whole UNIX operating system was written in C, it has a strong association with the operating system⁣
    C has also been used widely while creating iOS and Android kernels.⁣
    MySQL database is written using C.⁣
    Ruby and Pearl are mostly written using C.⁣
    Most part of Apache and NGINX is written using C.⁣
    Embedded Systems are created using C⁣


    Why should we learn C/ Features of C?
    As mentioned above, it is one of the most popular programming languages in the world.
    Learning any other popular programming language such as Python or C++ becomes a cakewalk already if you know C.
    C is a flexible language and that gets proven by the fact that it can be used in a variety of applications as
    well as technologies.
    C is very fast when compared to other programming languages be it Java or Python.

    How is it different from C++?
    The syntax of C++ is almost identical to that of C, as C++ was developed as an extension of C.
    In contrast to C, C++ supports classes and objects.

  <p id="Css">C++ Overview<b>What is C++?</b>
    C++ was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup, as an extension to the C language.

    Despite being an 80s creation, C++ has been a popular programming language throughout these years.

    C++ is a cross-platform language that can be used to create high-performance applications and software systems.

    C++ is very close to the hardware making it comparatively easy for programmers to give the instructions directly
    to the system without any intermediary giving programmers a high level of control over system resources and
    memory.



    Why should we learn C++/ Features of C++?
    C++ is one of the world's most popular programming languages.

    In today's operating systems, GUIs, and embedded systems, C++ is widely used.

    It is one of the most popular programming languages for its object-orientedness. C++ is an object-oriented
    programming language that gives a clear structure to programs and allows code to be reused, lowering development
    costs.

    With C++, you can develop applications or heavy games that can run on different platforms.

    As C++ is close to other programming languages such as C# and Java, which makes it easy for programmers to
    switch to C++ or vice versa while it is actually very easy to learn.



    How is it different from C?

    The syntax of C++ is almost identical to that of C, as C++ was developed as an extension of C.

  <p id="Css">HTML Introduction
    What is HTML?
    HTML is an initialism for "HyperText Markup Language".
    It is the language of the web.
    It is used to create websites.
    It is used to define a page layout, meaning it is a barebone page structure.
    HTML is used for making pages of the website also called webpages that we see on the internet
    It consists of a set of tags.
    This set of tags is written in HTML Document.
    ".html" or ".htm" is the extension.
    There are so many versions of HTML but HTML5 is the latest version.

    Features of HTML
    It is platform-independent.
    Images, videos, and audio can be added to a web page.
    Hypertext can be added to the text.
    It is a markup language.
    It is interpreted language
    It can be integrated with other languages like CSS, JavaScript etc.
    Semantic Structure.
    local Storage & Indexed DB – Client-side data storage.
    Offline Capabilities (PWA) with Cache API & Service Workers.

    Why the word HyperText & Markup Language
    The word hypertext markup language comprises the words “hypertext” and “markup language”. The term "hypertext"
    refers to the linking of text with other documents and “markup language” refers to a language that uses a set of
    tags.

    So, HTML is the linking of text with other documents using some set of tags.

      <head>. Each tag has a different meaning and importance in building an HTML page which can affect the web page in
        its own ways

  <p id="PHP">PHP Overview
    PHP is a server-side scripting language, which is used to manage dynamic web pages, databases and build websites
    with features like session tracking and e-commerce. On a day of 1995, Rasmus Lerdorf unleashed the first version of
    “Hypertext Preprocessor” also known as the PHP language. It is also integrated with several popular databases like
    MySQL, PostgreSQL, Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle etc.



    Uses of PHP
    PHP can perform several system functions like opening files, CRUD operations on data stores, general-purpose
    scripting, etc. Besides system operations, there are also other uses like

    Handling Forms: PHP can handle form operations. It can gather data, save data to a file and send data through
    emails.
    Database Operations: PHP can also create, read, update and delete elements in your database.
    Encryption: It can perform advanced encryption and encrypt data for you.
    Dynamic Page Content: It can generate dynamic page content.


    Basic Syntax PHP
    A PHP script can be written anywhere inside the HTML document. A PHP script starts with
    <?php tag and ends with ?>. We can write our logic inside this tag and it will be executed accordingly.
