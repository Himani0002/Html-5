            Tesla is an American
            multinational automotive and clean energy company headquartered in
            Austin, Texas. Tesla designs and manufactures electric vehicles
            (electric cars and trucks), battery energy storage from home to
            grid-scale, solar panels and solar roof tiles, and related products and
            services. Tesla is one of the world's most valuable companies and, as of
            2023, is the world's most valuable automaker. In 2022, the company had
            the most worldwide sales of battery electric vehicles, capturing 18% of
            the market. Through its subsidiary Tesla Energy, the company develops
            and is a major installer of photovoltaic systems in the United States.
            Tesla Energy is also one of the largest global suppliers of battery
            energy storage systems, with 6.5 gigawatt-hours (GWh) installed in 2022.
            Tesla was incorporated in July 2003 by Martin Eberhard and Marc
            Tarpenning as Tesla Motors. The company's name is a tribute to inventor
            and electrical engineer Nikola Tesla. In February 2004, via a $6.5
            million investment, Elon Musk became the largest shareholder of the
            company. He has served as CEO since 2008. According to Musk, the purpose
            of Tesla is to help expedite the move to sustainable transport and
            energy, obtained through electric vehicles and solar power. Tesla began
            production of its first car model, the Roadster sports car, in 2008.
            This was followed by the Model S sedan in 2012, the Model X SUV in 2015,
            the Model 3 sedan in 2017, the Model Y crossover in 2020, and the Tesla
            Semi truck in 2022. The company plans to start production of the
            Cybertruck light-duty pickup truck in 2023.[8] The Model 3 is the
            all-time bestselling plug-in electric car worldwide, and in June 2021
            became the first electric car to sell 1 million units globally.[9]
            Tesla's 2022 full year deliveries were around 1.31 million vehicles, a
            40% increase over the previous year,[10][11] and cumulative sales
            totaled 3 million cars as of August 2022.[12] In October 2021, Tesla's
            market capitalization reached $1 trillion, the sixth company to do so in
            U.S. history. Tesla has been the subject of several lawsuits, government
            scrutiny, journalistic criticism, and public controversies arising from
            statements and acts of CEO Elon Musk and from allegations of
            whistleblower retaliation, worker rights violations, and defects with
            their products.

        <p>
            Founding (2003–2004) The company was incorporated as Tesla Motors, Inc.
            on July 1, 2003, by Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning.[13] Eberhard
            and Tarpenning served as CEO and CFO, respectively.[14] Eberhard said he
            wanted to build "a car manufacturer that is also a technology company",
            with its core technologies as "the battery, the computer software, and
            the proprietary motor".[15] Ian Wright was Tesla's third employee,
            joining a few months later.[13] In February 2004, the company raised
            $7.5 million in series A funding, including $6.5 million from Elon Musk,
            who had received $100 million from the sale of his interest in PayPal
            two years earlier. Musk became the chairman of the board of directors
            and the largest shareholder of Tesla.[16][17][14] J. B. Straubel joined
            Tesla in May 2004 as chief technical officer.[18] A lawsuit settlement
            agreed to by Eberhard and Tesla in September 2009 allows all five –
            Eberhard, Tarpenning, Wright, Musk, and Straubel – to call themselves
            co-founders.[19]

            from the Lotus Elise chassis,[161] that was produced from 2008 to 2012.
            The Roadster was the first highway legal serial production all-electric
            car to use lithium-ion battery cells and the first production
            all-electric car to travel more than 200 miles (320 km) per charge. It
            is also the first production car to be launched into space; Musk
            launched his Roadster into a Mars-crossing orbit on a SpaceX Falcon
            Heavy rocket test flight on February 6, 2018.[162]
